# ## Confidence Interval and CLT

# ## `1. Business Problem and Analyzing basic maetrics:`
# 1. Analyze the **customer purchase behavior** (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions.
# 2. The spending habits between **male and female customers**: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men?

# # `Recommendations:`
# 1. **Age:**
# ```
# a. 78% of the Purchases on Black Friday are done by the age group 26-35 > 36-45 > 18-25 yrs, hence focus/target customers should be from this bracket and accordingly make changes in the product.
# b. On Average age group, 51-55yrs spend most per bill > 36-45yrs > Above 55yrs. Offers and Campaigns can be run to attract these customers to buy more. Offer like on purchase of particular amount you get a discount or get a voucher of a certain amount for future purchases.
# ```
# 2. **Occupation:**
# ```
# a. The average purchase is highest by the customers from Occupation Category 15,12 and 17.
# b. The customers from this occupation category have a higher budget, hence products can be designed as per the occupational relatability.
# ```
# 3. **Product Category:**
# ```
# a. Try selling more products from categories 6,7,9,10,15 and 16.
# b. Make some variance in marketing/product for products from categories 19,13,20,12,4 to attract more customers. For eg: some bulk offers, extra savings, etc.
# ```
# 4. **Gender:**
# ```
# a. Men tend to have a higher average purchase per bill compared to women. One of many reasons could be women are buying more from 5,8 and 1. These products fall cheaper compared to other categories.
# b. Champaign and marketing can be done on products from categories 6,7,9,10,15 to attract women. 
# ```
# 5. **Purchases are the most correlated with Gender, and Male purchases are more compared to females.**
# ```
# ```
# 6. **Confidence Interval:**
# ```
# a. As 90% of Male customers' purchase bills are between USD 9424 - 9450, an offer can be created at USD 9999. This will increase the purchase amount by USD 500 and help retain the customers by offering comeback vouchers.
# 
# Similarly, 90% of Female customersâ€™ purchase bills are between USD 8713 - 8755, offers/vouchers/discount can be run with the help of this interval.
# 
# Married and Unmarried customers' confidence interval overlaps, hence customersâ€™ marital status will not make a difference.
# ```
# 
# 7. As per the above, the target customers have been pictured out. So keeping in mind the target some necessary changes in product, marketing, and pricing will help in increasing the purchases on **Black Friday.**
